[![N|Solid](https://www.rabbitmq.com/img/logo-rabbitmq.svg)](https://www.cypress.io/)

I created a project to show how to use the RabbitMQ sending and receiving messages. 

  - It will be send a message to RabbitMQ
  - It will be read a message from RabbitMQ

# How to use!

  - The first step, you will need to do the clone of this repository.
  - After cloned this repository, you'll need to install the RabbitMQ in your OS.
  - After to install the RabbitMQ is necessary to install the OTP.
  - After that will be necessary to active the RabbitMQ with this command.
  
```sh
$ rabbitmq-plugins enable rabbit_management
```

Look that:
  - The localhost RabbitMQ Dashboard will open at ``` http://localhost:15672 ```

Run the Producer project and the Consumer project
